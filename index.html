        <h3>Hello! Thank you for playing Battleship!</h3>
        <p><strong>Rules:</strong></p>
        <p>
          In this game you take turns guessing where your enemy's ships are
          located by clicking squares on the enemy's grid (Computer).
        </p>
        <p>
          If you successfully hit a ship, the square will be marked with an 'X'
          and turn red. If you miss, the square will be marked with an 'O'. The
          computer will then take a turn and try to hit your ships, which are
          marked with an 'S'.
        </p>
        <p>
          The game will end when you have sunk all of your enemy's ships, or
          when they have sunk all of yours! Have fun!

        <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
        <p>When you click the button below, you will place five ships:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The Carrier (5 squares long)</li>
          <li>The Battleship (4 squares long)</li>
          <li>The Destroyer (3 squares long)</li>
          <li>The Submarine (3 squares long)</li>
          <li>The Patrol Boat (2 squares)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Ships can be placed horizontally (left and right) or vertically (up
          and down). Ships cannot be placed diagonally, or on top of each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          After clicking the button you will be prompted ten times to enter in
          the start and end coordinates of your five ships. Use the grid shown
          below to place your ships.
        </p>
        <p>
          (It may be helpful to draw out where you want your ships to go ahead
          of time on a piece of paper)
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            You will be prompted to place the ships in the above order (Carrier
            first, Battleship second, etc.)
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Example of how to place a ship:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>On the first prompt type "3,4"</li>
            <li>On the second prompt type "6,4"</li>
            <li>This will result in a ship being placed as shown in the grid below</li>
        </ul>
